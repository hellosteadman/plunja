{"name":"Plunja.js","tagline":"A simple JavaScript templating system, inspired by Jinja2","body":"# Plunja.js\r\n\r\nPlunja is a simple JavaScript templating system that takes blocks of HTML\r\nstored in `<script>` tags and renders them with context objects. It was\r\ninspired by [Jinja2][1].\r\n\r\nYou don't need a JavaScript framework to use it, as you can define your own\r\ncustom locator (ie: a way of finding the template from the DOM). The built-in\r\nlocator uses jQuery, but it's really simple to define your own.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nYou can use it with jQuery out-of-the-box, by including jQuery and the\r\nplunja.js file.\r\n\r\nYou start by creating a template registry which you'll then use to locate and\r\nrender your templates.\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n      $(document).ready(\r\n        function() {\r\n          var templates = new TemplateRegistry();\r\n        }\r\n      );\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Plunja.js without jQuery, or you have a better method for\r\nlocating templates, you'll need to define your own locator, like so:\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n      var templates = new TemplateRegistry(\r\n        {\r\n          locator: function(name) {\r\n              return document.getElementById('template-' + name).innerHTML;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      );\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nYou can define your own filters, to go with the couple of sample ones already\r\nbundled in:\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n      var templates = new TemplateRegistry(\r\n        {\r\n          filters: {\r\n            reversed: function(value) {\r\n              var ret = '';\r\n              for(var i = 0; i < value.length; i ++) {\r\n                ret = value[i] + ret;\r\n              }\r\n              return ret;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      );\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n   [1]: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
